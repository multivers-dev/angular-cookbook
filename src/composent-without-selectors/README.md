# Component Without Selectors

```admonish note
Creating components without selectors is an effective method for building reusable components. Such components can be employed in various scenarios, including:

- **Route Components:** Navigate between different views in your application.
- **Dynamic Components:** Dynamically generate and insert components based on user actions or application logic.

This approach proves advantageous when aiming to minimize the overall build size of your application. By omitting selectors, you streamline the components for specific purposes without introducing unnecessary overhead.
