# Internationalization

Internationalization is the process of designing and preparing your app to be usable in different languages. Localization is the process of translating your internationalized app into specific languages for particular locales.

We will see how to use the following libraries:
- [i18N](./i18n.md)
- [ngx-translate](./ngx-translate.md)
- [Transloco](./transloco.md)
- [angular-i18next (i18next)](./i18next.md)
